		<p>Artificial death in the West 
			East Pyramids on deck shine Wet hair on her neck breathe She shoot <span class="p">XXX</span> through your chest</p> 

<big><big><big><p>you die</p></big></big></big>

 There was a artificial death in the West East All pyramids on deck shine Wet hair on her neck breathe <span class="l">G-O-D</span>, she shoot <span class="p">XXX</span> through your chest</p>

<big><big><p>you die</p></big></big>

<large><b>Where you runnin' now?</b></big>

<p>I'm barely there I'm everywhere Heavy thin air Sahara mascara smeared end of an era Tracks on Hera's peacock thighs china white Skies ivory of my leper eyes Tone of sighs off nylon lips Where you runnin' now? In fishnet wet guise of gimp horizon slit Bled like my wrist I suck it dry Which nipple's mine read the signs still can't decide At your own risk, at your own risk Don't touch me bitch, don't touch me bitch Where you runnin' now? Accustomed to these satin glitches drippin from my casket's inners Charmer play me out the basket last image I saw was splintered My reflection wasn't in it, in slow motion I give in</p>

 <p><b>Where you runnin' now?</b></p> 
<small>where you runnin now?</small>


<p> Hopeless premonitions Tomorrow didn't come some say it's hiding But they're the ones who've hidden Euphoria followed by visions of peasants eating pigeons Where you runnin' now, where you runnin' now? There was a artificial death in the West East All pyramids on deck shine Wet hair on her neck breathe <span class="l">G-O-D</span> she shoot <span class="p">XXX</span>through your chest</p>

  <big><p>you die</p></big>
  Where you runnin' now? Watching me watching me watch them watch me Hole in this platinum ship of fools nomadic rule concept no rules Mobile shrine of this destitute wasteland mute Screaming at me winking at me like I love it Fucking wit me fuck it My star gate in a vacuum monitors eye view This valley is an urn this valley I'm wading through Where you runnin' now? Feel like I'm chasing after me feel Like dead weight in a sea of Vaseline All that can't be seen watching me watching me watch them watch me Try not to dwell on my cell my empty shell shedding me Where you runnin' now? Artificial death in the west east Pyramids on deck shine Where you runnin' now? No matter where I turn shut down shut down Everyone's a runaway, where you runnin' now? There was a artificial death in the West East All pyramids on deck shine Wet hair on her neck breathe <span class="l">G-O-D</span> she shoot <span class="p">XXX</span>through your chest</p>
